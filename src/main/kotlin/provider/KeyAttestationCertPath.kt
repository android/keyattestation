/**

 * The expected input is a full key attestation certificate chain (i.e. the output of
 * `KeyStore.getCertificateChain()`) in the following order:
 * 1. Leaf certificate (containing the extension)
 * 2. Attestation certificate (contains the ProvisioningInfo extension if remotely provisioned)
 * 3. Intermediate certificate
 * 5. [Intermediate certificate] (if remotely provisioned)
 * 4. Root certificate

 * starting with the target certificate and ending with a certificate issued by the trust anchor.
 * That is, the issuer of one certificate is the subject of the following one. The certificate
 * representing the TrustAnchor should not be included in the certification path."
